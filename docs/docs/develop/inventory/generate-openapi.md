# Generate OpenAPI Spec

The OpenAPI Specification (OAS) defines a standard, language-agnostic interface to RESTful APIs. It allows both humans and computers to understand the capabilities of a service without access to source code or documentation. When you generate an OpenAPI spec for your API, you can use it to generate documentation, client libraries, and more.
