After creating your API Center, the next step is to start registering your APIs to build a centralized inventory. For each API, you will also add an API version with an API definition. 

## 1. Service API

- Visit the deployed APIâ€™s documentation (docs/json), and save the OpenAPI json definition (service-get.json)
- Click on the API Center extension, right click on `APIs` and select `Register API`
 
    - Manual
    - API Title: contoso-services
    - API Type: REST

    - Lifecycle: Development
    - API Definition title: openapi
    - Specification name: OpenAPI
