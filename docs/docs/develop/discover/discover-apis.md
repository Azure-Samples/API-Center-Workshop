# Discover all APIs

_Persona: **API Developer**_

Once logged in to your Azure account, you can discover APIs from the Azure API Center directly in Visual Studio Code. Open the extension by clicking on the Azure API Center icon in the sidebar.

Here, you will see a tree view of all the APIs available in your organization. Next to the title `APIs`, you will see a Search icon, which you can click on to search for specific APIs.

## View API Documentation

Once you have discovered an API, you can view its documentation directly in Visual Studio Code.

Click on the API you are interested in, expand the `Versions`, then `Definitions` and right click on the `OpenAPI` definition file to `Open API documentation`.
