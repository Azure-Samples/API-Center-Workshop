# View API Documentation

_Persona: **API Developer**_

Once you have discovered an API, you can view its documentation directly in Visual Studio Code.

Click on the API you are interested in, expand the `Versions`, then `Definitions` and right click on the `OpenAPI` definition file to`Open API documentation`.
