# About this workshop

This flash workshop gives you a comprehensive understanding of how to enhance the API management and governance strategies in your organization. You will gain valuable insights into the capabilities of the Azure API Center, which is a structured inventory for tracking all your APIs, enhancing discoverability, development, and reuse regardless of their type, lifecycle stage or deployment location. This knowledge will empower you to streamline secure API integration, enforcing security and compliance with tools that evolve to meet your growing business needs.

## Background

API Management is a broad term encompassing various aspects of managing APIs. Today, we'll explore how Microsoft provides distinct comprehensive solutions for effective API management through two key services that address different facets of this process:

    - **Azure API Management** - Focuses on API deployment and runtime governance, ensuring your APIs are secure, scalable, and monitored effectively.
    - **Azure API Center** - Concentrates on API registration (inventory) and design-time governance, helping you maintain a structured API inventory and ensuring your APIs meet organizational standards from the design phase.

By leveraging both services, you can achieve a holistic approach to API management, covering everything from initial design to deployment and ongoing governance.

## What you’ll learn

1. Spin up an API Center instance
1. Register APIs into API Center
1. Import APIs from Azure API Management into API Center
1. Enforce governance and security policies at scale
