# Introduction

In the current era of digital transformation, organizations are increasingly adopting cloud-based technologies and incorporating microservice patterns, which has been a catalyst in significantly escalating the use of Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). The application of these APIs stretches across a diverse array of platforms, various environments, and different architectural designs, which suggests a gradual evolution in technological infrastructure that is crucial in sustaining a prosperous business landscape.

However, organizations struggling to adapt to this API proliferation, face three major challenges:

- The first is the complex task of identifying APIs due to a proliferation of platforms, API Gateways and other tools implemented by disparate teams and environments, forming a complicated maze and creating significant obstacles for modern organizations.
- Secondly, each API, which enables varied functionalities across multiple environments and platforms, carries its own unique set of quality standards. This evolving and diverse API landscape spawns a complex management area for IT departments, particularly while managing multiple versions and embodiments of APIs, resembling a daunting trap requiring extensive effort to manage an overwhelming number of API variations.
- Thirdly, the recent spike in security attacks directed at APIs, pose a significant concern for today's enterprises. The arrival of concealed or 'shadow' APIs introduces potential security risks, obliging companies to conduct exhaustive forensic evaluations to determine potential damage and strategize appropriate mitigation tactics. Thus, mitigating these security risks demands proper API Governance and ongoing threat monitoring capabilities to safeguard an organization's digital ecosystem.
